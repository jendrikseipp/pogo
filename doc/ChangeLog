    NOTE: Decibel Audio Player can now use the playbin2 GStreamer component, which notably provides a better gapless playback.

          cannot play audio CDs. For these reasons, this component is used only if the --playbin2 option is provided on the command
          line when starting Decibel Audio Player.
